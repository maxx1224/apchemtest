### Question 1

A silver alloy with a mass of 15.33 g, is dissolved in acid to create an aqueous solution containing aqueous silver ions. A large excess of aqueous sodium bromide is added to the solution containing the silver ions, and a precipitate forms. The precipitate that now contains the silver ions is filtered, dried thoroughly, and weighed, and is found to have a mass of 8.22 g

(a) Write a balanced net ionic chemical equation to show the reaction of aqueous silver ions with aqueous bromide ions that produces the solid precipitate. Include state symbols. (2)

**Ag⁺(aq) + Br⁻(aq) → AgBr(s)**

(b) What is the purpose of adding a 'large excess' of aqueous sodium bromide? (1)

**To ensure that all of the silver ions were precipitated**

(c) Use the data to calculate the percentage of silver in the original alloy. (4)

**Moles of AgBr = (8.22 g/187.77 g mol⁻¹) = 4.378 x 10⁻² mols = Moles of Ag⁺ = Moles of Ag**

**Mass of Ag = (4.378 x 10⁻² moles of Ag)(107.87 g mol⁻¹) = 4.722 g**

**% by mass in the alloy = (4.722 g/15.33 g)*100 = 30.8 %**

(d) If the precipitate were not dried completely, what effect would this have on the calculated % of silver metal in the alloy? Explain. (2)

**It would be calculated as being too high. The mass of the precipitate would include water and so would be too large, making the moles of the precipitate too large, making the moles of the silver too large, and the mass of the silver too large.**

### Question 2

Samples of four different gases are separately placed into four identical containers, each with the same pressure, the same volume and the same temperature. The four gases are helium (He), nitrogen (N₂), methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). You may assume that they act as ideal gases.

(a) Which gas would have the smallest value for 'b' in the van der Waals equation for *real* gases? (The equation is shown below). Explain your answer. (2)

$$(P + \frac{an^2}{V^2})(V - nb) = nRT$$

**He. The magnitude of the value for b reflects the volume that the particles themselves occupy. Helium atoms have the smallest volume of the gases listed**

(b) Which container has the greatest number of moles of gas? Explain your answer, but there is no need to perform any calculations. (2)

**All have the same. The values for P, V, T and R are all identical, and if the gases behave ideally then n must have the same value in each case**

(c) In which container to the particles have,

(i) the smallest kinetic energy. Explain your answer. (2)

**All have the same. Kinetic energy is dependent upon temperature, and in each case the temperature is identical**

(ii) the greatest average velocity? Explain your answer. (2)

**He. Since kinetic energy is the same for all of the gases, and KE = ½ mv², as mass decreases, velocity increases. He atoms have the smallest mass.**

(d) Draw a Lewis structure for the carbon dioxide molecule and identify the geometry of the atoms. (2)

**Linear**

### Question 3

The first ten ionization energies in units of kJ/mol for the element magnesium, are given below.

| **1st** | **2nd** | **3rd** | **4th** | **5th** | **6th** | **7th** | **8th** | **9th** | **10th** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| 738     | 1451    | 7733    | 10543   | 13630   | 18020   | 21711   | 25661   | 31653   | 35458    |

(a) Account for the large increase in ionization energy between the 2nd and 3rd values. (2)

**The first and second electrons are removed from the 3s energy level, but the 3rd electron is removed from an inner shell (n = 2), that is closer to the nucleus, experiences a much greater Coulombic attraction, meaning a much larger amount of energy is required to overcome the greater attraction**

(b) Calculate the minimum wavelength of a photon that could be used to convert a single, neutral magnesium atom (Mg) to a magnesium ion with a charge of +1 (Mg⁺). (2)

**(738 kJ mol⁻¹)/(6.022 x 10²³ mol⁻¹) = 1.226 x10⁻²¹ kJ per atom = 1.226 x10⁻¹⁸ J per atom**

**E = h υ = 1.226 x10⁻¹⁸ J = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J s) (υ)**

**υ = 1.85 x 10¹⁵ s⁻¹**

**c = λ υ = 2.998 x 10⁸ ms⁻¹ = (λ) (υ)**

**λ = 1.62 x 10⁻⁷ m**

### Question 4

One of the particles in solid potassium chloride, KCl, is shown below being hydrated by water molecules.

[Hydration diagram]

(a) Identify which species is being hydrated in the diagram above. Explain your answer. (2)

**K⁺. The δ- end of the water molecules dipoles are pointing towards the positve ion.**

(b) Explain why KCl will conduct electricity when it is hydrated in aqueous solution, but not when it is a solid. (1)

**In the solid state the ions are held in a rigid lattice and are not free to move, but when hydrated the lattice breaks down, and the ions become free to move, acting as charge carriers in solution**

(c) Choosing from the list below, identify the best description of the interaction between the water molecules and the particle from potassium chloride shown in the diagram above. (1)

*ion to dipole, dipole to dipole, ion to induced dipole, ion to ion*

**Ion to dipole**
